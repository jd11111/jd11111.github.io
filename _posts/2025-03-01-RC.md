title:  "The RC Circuit Analysed With An Oscilloscope"

I recently got an oscilloscope (a PicoScope 2204A to be precise) and wrote a python wrapper around its C API, which can be found [here on my github](https://github.com/jd11111/scope-py).
I analysed the so called "RC circuit" with it.
The RC circuit consists of a resistor and a capacitor in series.
The PDF with the analysis of the RC circuit can be found [here](/assets/rc.pdf).
